# A squid for indexing LiquidationCalls on the AAVE lending platform

This tiny blockchain indexer scrapes `LiquidationCall` events emitted by the [AAVE V2 Lending Pool contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9) and serves the data over a GraphQL API. It is built with the [Subsquid framework](https://subsquid.io), hence the term "squid".

I wrote about how I made it in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/subsquid/developing-blockchain-indexers-part-2-simplest-nontrivial-examples-2f8509bc5c4#8233).

Dependencies: NodeJS, Docker.

To see it in action, begin by spinning up a *processor*, a process that ingests the data from the Ethereum Archive:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abernatskiy/liquidations-squid
$ cd liquidations-squid/
$ npm i
$ make build
$ make up # starts a Postgres database in a Docker container
$ make process # begins data ingestion
```

Then start the GraphQL server:

```bash
$ make serve
```

GraphQL playground should be available at [localhost:4350/graphql](http://localhost:4350/graphql).
